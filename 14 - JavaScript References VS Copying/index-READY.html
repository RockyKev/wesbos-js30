    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100; 
    let age2 = age; 
    console.log(age, age2); //-> 100 100

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); //-> 200 100

    let name = "RK";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); //-> RK RK

    name = "Rocky";
    console.log(name, name2); //-> RK Rocky



    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;



    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way - this will copy the actual array. 
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    //////////////////////////////////////////
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;

    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(captain); //-> 'Wes Bos', 99

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12})

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const rk = {
      name: "RK", 
      age: 100, 
      social: {
        twitter: '@rk', 
        facebook: 'rk.facebook'
      }
    }

    console.log(rk);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, rk, { number: 99, age: 34})

    //if you modify dev, it only safely clones the first level. 
    //If you need to deep clone, google it.

    //poor man's deep clone. Turn your object into a JSON, then turn it BACK into a object. 
    //Performance is bad.
